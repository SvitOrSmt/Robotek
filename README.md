## Story 
For a school project i had to make a robot, for a competition and my classmates decidet to make simple robots out of cardbord and servo motors,and
i decided to get my esp32 and 3d printer out. and i made a sick concept that has a filesystem, but becouse the esp dosent have alot of space i decided
to make it so the index file has all the lin kand is used as main directory and other ones are files that are inside, the inside files contain g-code 
like script that tells the robot how to move if i want to preprogram it. The robot also has an option to just work with user input but i tought it was cooler to just connect that as well. 

## How to replicate
- Shematics are available here so copy them or change the code acordingly.
- Add the plugins to make the esp work with arduino IDE
- Coppy and paste the code
- If you want to make youre own files make youre own github repo just for the structure coppy mine and paste raw links
